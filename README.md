#### MVVM Pors
* clarity of code, reactiveness, and testability
* in iOS, View is essentially a ViewController and ViewModel is an object (a structure) which provides exact data for the view to render.
* This provides a loosely coupled architecture which is maintainable ( very thin view controllers ) and testable (ViewModel abstracts out the UI and hence is easily testable)
